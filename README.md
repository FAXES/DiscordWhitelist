*Say hi to DiscordWhitelist, the number 1 whitelist resource for FiveM!*

Hate updating those ACE Permission white-lists? Well just use Discord! DiscordWhitelist allows you to use a dynamic whitelist system based off of Discord roles. Simply change the configuration to best fit your community! So keep white-lists easy and breezy. Oh, also, we forgot to mention there's also a blacklisted roles system, just incase you prefer to blacklist users.

**Documentation:**
- [Discord Whitelist Installation](https://docs.faxes.zone/c/fivem/discordwhitelist)
- [FAXES Documentation Site](https://docs.faxes.zone)
- [FAXES Website](docs.faxes.zone)
